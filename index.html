    cats.</p>

  <p>My little guys are adults now but they still bring so much light to the house. They are forever clowns, running around and playing together, as brothers do.</p>
  <h2>Picking Out Kittens</h2>
  <p>When we started thinking about adding a kitten to the family, we had to consider where to find the right one. Kittens are often available for sale or adoption, and sometimes even given away. Our current cat at the time had been a rescueâ€”picked up by my husband behind a dumpster. While pet stores offer animals, I've never purchased one from a store. Instead, we decided to go with an amazing local rescue called <a href="https://spaythestrays.rescuegroups.org" Target ="_blank"> Spay the Strays</a>. They take in stray cats, provide spaying or neutering, vaccinations, and find them loving homes.After browsing the available kittens on their website, we called to schedule a meet-and-greet. During the call, they suggested adopting siblings, explaining that it often leads to the best outcome. Since the kittens have been together since birth, keeping them together makes the transition into a new home much easier. Their close bond brings comfort and security, resulting in adorable snuggles and plenty of laughter as they play together.</p>
