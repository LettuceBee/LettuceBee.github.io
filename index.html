  <p>I always had pets growing up.I really loved them all, however I always had a special place in my heart for the
    cats.</p>

    <li>Cats can be very independant</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My little guys are adults now but they still bring so much light to the house. They are forever clowns, running around and playing together, as brothers do.</p>
  <h2>Picking Out Kittens</h2>
  <p>When we started considering adding a kitten to the family, we had to think about how we wanted to get the kitten. People seem to always be selling or giving away kittens. Our current cat at the time, was one my husband picked up from behind a dumpster. There are also pet stores (I have never purchased animal from a pet store) or rescues and shelters. We ultimately went with a fanstatic rescue called <a href="https://spaythestrays.rescuegroups.org" Target ="_blank"> Spay the Strays</a>. They are a local rescue that takes stray cats, spays or neuters, vacinates them and finds them loving homes. After we browsed the kitties they had available on the website we called to book a meet and greet. During our phone call one of the suggestions they made was to take siblings. They pointed out that it often leads to the best outcome. The kittens have been together since birth and keeping them together makes the adjustment so much easier. The cats being so comfortable with eah other leads to adorable snuggling moments and lots of laughs as they play together.</p>
